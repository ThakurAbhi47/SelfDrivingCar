# SelfDrivingCar
The primary objective of this project is to simulate self-driving cars using Python programming language and artificial intelligence techniques. This simulation aims to demonstrate the potential of AI in autonomous vehicle technology by creating a realistic environment where virtual cars navigate various scenarios autonomously.
